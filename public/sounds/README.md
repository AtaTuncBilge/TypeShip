# Sound Files for TypeShip

This directory must contain the following sound files:

- `keypress1.mp3` - Typing sound
- `spaceship-ambient-27988.mp3` - Background ambient music

Make sure these sound files are present and in MP3 format. The audio files should be placed directly in this directory.

Sound levels should be normalized and not too loud, as they will be adjusted through the game's volume settings.
